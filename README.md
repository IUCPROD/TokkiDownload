How to make it work:

3.4 Go to the tokkidownload_application_chrome folder and open manifest.json with any editor application like notepad or windows editor
3.5 Under "allowed_origins" you will find "chrome-extension://eafopkeeefacjkabhkeadjnbeibkobee/", replace the part between the /// with your id you copied earlier and save the file
